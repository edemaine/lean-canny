# lean-canny

A Lean formalization of the existential theory of the reals (ETR) in PSPACE,
from John Canny's 1988 report
[*Some Algebraic and Geometric Computations in PSPACE*](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1988/6041.html).
The report is saved as [`canny-tr.pdf`](canny-tr.pdf).

The main results in [`ETR/CoercivePSPACE.lean`](LeanCanny/ETR/CoercivePSPACE.lean) are:

```lean
LeanCanny.ETR.etr_mem_PSPACE : LeanCanny.ETR.language ∈ LeanCanny.PSPACE
LeanCanny.ETR.existsReal_subset_PSPACE : LeanCanny.ExistsReal ⊆ LeanCanny.PSPACE
```

These are unconditional theorems for the project's encoded ETR language and
Complexitylib2's machine-based PSPACE class. The coefficient algorithms,
metadata preparation, recursive evaluation, and final sign decisions are
constructed internally. The development uses Lean 4.36.0-rc1 with pinned
Mathlib, CSLib, and Complexitylib2 dependencies.

This establishes the report's ETR PSPACE upper bound. The report's roadmap,
connectivity, and motion-planning algorithms remain outside the completed result.
The proof uses a coercive one-parameter sampling construction; it does not
formalize every intermediate construction in the report verbatim.

For an independently readable, checked statement, see
[`Abstract.lean`](LeanCanny/Abstract.lean). A reader can inspect its definitions
and theorem statements to assess the claimed result; Lean verifies the proofs
through [`AbstractBridge.lean`](LeanCanny/AbstractBridge.lean) and the development.
Import it with `import LeanCanny.Abstract`, or build it with
`lake build --wfail LeanCanny.Abstract`. It is also included in the default build.

## Build and verification

Install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then run:

```sh
lake update
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

[`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) and [`lake-manifest.json`](lake-manifest.json)
record the versions used. The public entry point is [`LeanCanny.lean`](LeanCanny.lean).

For stricter verification:

```sh
lake build --wfail
lake env lean scripts/CheckAxioms.lean
lake env lean scripts/CheckAbstract.lean
lake env lean scripts/CheckGrammar.lean
lake env lean scripts/CheckSpaceFoundation.lean
lake env lean scripts/CheckPolyTimeFoundation.lean
```

The axiom audit checks declarations in the `LeanCanny` namespace, local Nat
codec extensions, and their transitive dependencies, allowing only Lean's
standard `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound` axioms. The foundation
checks enforce the native Complexitylib2 time and space interfaces and reject
legacy machine dependencies. `CheckAbstract` also follows public definitions
and statement dependencies to reject hidden implementation references.

## Proof outline

1. **Compile ETR to one integer equation.** The binary grammar, normalization,
   and equation compiler have native polynomial-time certificates. Correctness
   covers every bitstring; malformed formulas are rejected. Degree, arity,
   encoded length, and coefficient-mass bounds are derived from the input.
2. **Construct bounded critical samples.** For the compiled polynomial q,
   minimize `q² + s * Σ Xᵢ^(2D+2)` as positive s tends to zero. Its gradient has
   finite fibers for every nonzero s. Bounded integer coordinate annihilants
   give a source-size root radius, so satisfiability is equivalent to eventual
   bounded critical samples with the required residual and penalty bounds.
3. **Compute annihilants and primitive coordinates.** A fixed full Macaulay
   block determinant supplies nonzero coordinate annihilants. Native modular
   readers feed actual integer degree/GCD/direction preparation. A uniform
   recursive symbolic evaluator computes the prepared primitive parameter;
   indexed pair readers and ordered matrix products compute its rational
   coordinates. All child computation costs and malformed metadata cases are
   included in the space certificates.
4. **Decide eventual signs.** Even denominator clearing preserves the sample
   equations and inequalities. Native readers compute the resulting integer
   bivariate queries without storing their expanded coefficients. The
   infinitesimal root/sign decision procedure decides four sign patterns in
   PSPACE. Their union is exactly ETR; closure under polynomial-time reductions
   gives `ExistsReal ⊆ PSPACE`.

[`SpaceFunction`](LeanCanny/Computation/SpaceFunction.lean) wraps
Complexitylib2's `ComputableTidilyInPolySpace`.
[`SpaceDecider`](LeanCanny/Computation/SpaceDecider.lean) carries membership in
its native PSPACE class. Polynomial-time reductions and all FP controls also
use Complexitylib2 directly. Space composition charges the original readers;
no free coefficient oracle or execution-time bound on a space-bounded child
is assumed.

## Other constructions and scope

The repository also develops Canny's compact tube and generic projection
constructions, projective elimination, finite-root sign feasibility, and
nonsingular tube sampling. These are independently proved ingredients and
alternative samplers. The tube route's effective epsilon/delta/direction and
retained-level choices are unresolved; the completed ETR theorem uses the
coercive route and does not depend on those choices.

Further work includes relating this encoding to other ETR presentations,
proving the NP lower inclusion, and formalizing the report's roadmap and
connectivity consequences. See [`RESEARCH.md`](RESEARCH.md) for prior work,
proof details, and the unused tube route's precise gaps.
